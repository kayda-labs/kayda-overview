# Onur Okcal — AI Systems Architect, Kayda AI

I design and build behavior-first AI systems where memory, continuity,
and safety boundaries are treated as first-class concerns.

For the past two years, I’ve been building KaydaAI:
an emotionally intelligent companion with a production-grade backend,
focused on long-session stability and safe degradation under failure.

## What I work on
- Behavior-first AI system design
- Memory & continuity across long-running conversations
- API-first backends (UI optional)
- Safety boundaries and trust-preserving constraints

## Current focus
Exploring how AI products behave over time — not just how they respond.

Based in Hanoi, Vietnam.
